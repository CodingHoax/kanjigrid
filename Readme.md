# 漢字グリッド (kanjigrid)

![kanjigrid](screenshot.png)

A web-app displaying the 2200 kanji characters taught in James Heisig's "Remembering the Kanji", 6th edition.

All kanji are searchable by their components or "radicals". Kun-Yomi and On-Yomi readings as well as example words using the selected kanji are also displayed.

Additionally, users can input their learning progress and daily amount of kanji being learned in order to have the app automatically track and display their progress.
